## Integrations

An integration is a module that can consume the `Appsignal` object to catch errors from popular libraries or frameworks. These integrations may come in a variety of different forms, and we aim to generally provide APIs that are consistent, and feel idiomatic to use, with the libraries and/or frameworks that youâ€™re using.

These currently include:

- [React (beta) - `@appsignal/react`](/front-end/integrations/react.html)
- [Vue (beta) - `@appsignal/vue`](/front-end/integrations/vue.html)
- [Angular (beta) - `@appsignal/angular`](/front-end/integrations/angular.html)
- [Ember (beta) - `@appsignal/ember`](/front-end/integrations/ember.html)
- [Preact (beta) - `@appsignal/preact`](/front-end/integrations/preact.html)
- [Stimulus (beta) - `@appsignal/stimulus`](/front-end/integrations/stimulus.html)
