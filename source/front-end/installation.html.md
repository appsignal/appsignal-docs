title: "Installing AppSignal for JavaScript"
---

Please follow the [installation guide](/guides/new-application.html) first, when adding a new application to AppSignal.

## Creating a Push API Key

Before you begin, you'll need to find your Push API key on the ["Push and deploy" section](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=info) of your App settings page. You'll be able to find your API key under the "Front-end error monitoring". Once you have your key, follow the instructions under the [Installation](/front-end/installation.html) section to use it in your application.

## Installation

First, add the `@appsignal/javascript` package to your `package.json`. Then, run `yarn install`/`npm install`. You'll also need a Front-end error monitoring key from the ["Push and deploy" section](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=info) of your App settings page.

You can also add these packages to your `package.json` on the command line:

```bash
yarn add @appsignal/javascript
npm install --save @appsignal/javascript
```

You can then import and use the package in your bundle:

```javascript
import Appsignal from "@appsignal/javascript"; // For ES Module
const Appsignal = require("@appsignal/javascript").default; // For CommonJS module

const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  key: "YOUR FRONTEND API KEY",
});
```

Itâ€™s recommended (although not necessarily required) to use the instance of the `Appsignal` object like a singleton. One way that you can do this is by `export`ing an instance of the library from a `.js`/`.ts` file somewhere in your project.

```javascript
import Appsignal from "@appsignal/javascript";

export default new Appsignal({
  key: "YOUR FRONTEND API KEY",
});
```

Currently, we have no plans to supply a CDN-hosted version of this library.

!> **NOTE:** If you are running a CDN in front of your assets, you'll need to make [two changes](/front-end/troubleshooting.html) for error reporting to be able to send errors to our API endpoint. Read more about the [required changes](/front-end/troubleshooting.html). <br /><br />If you use Content Security Policy, make sure to add the correct headers as [described here](/front-end/troubleshooting.html#content-security-policy-csp).

-> ðŸ“– Continue with our [installation guide](/guides/new-application.html).

## Uninstall

Uninstall AppSignal from your app by following the steps below. When these steps are completed your app will no longer send data to the AppSignal servers.

1. In the `package.json` of your app, delete all lines referencing an `appsignal` package: `"*appsignal/*": "*"`.
1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update your `package.lock`/`yarn.lock` with the removed packages state.
   - Alternatively, run `npm uninstall @appsignal/<package name>` or `yarn remove @appsignal/<package name>` to uninstall an AppSignal package.
1. Remove any AppSignal [configuration](/front-end/configuration/) from your app.
1. Commit, deploy and restart your app.
  - This will make sure the AppSignal servers won't continue to receive data from your app.
1. Finally, [remove the app](/guides/application/deleting-applications.html) on AppSignal.com.
