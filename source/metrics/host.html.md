title: "Host metrics"
---

The AppSignal agent collects various system metrics, which allows you to correlate performance issues and errors to abnormal host metrics. This data is available in the [Host metrics](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=host_metrics) section in the app overview, which allows you to inspect and [compare multiple hosts](https://blog.appsignal.com/2018/02/20/comparing-hosts.html). We also show a host metrics overview on the sample detail page for error and performance incidents.

For a preview of how host metrics look in the AppSignal interface, please see our [host metrics](https://appsignal.com/tour/hosts) tour page.

## Collected host metrics

The following host metrics are collected by the AppSignal agent for every minute on your system.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CPU usage</td>
      <td>

These host metrics are collected by default. To disable it, use the `enable_host_metrics` configuration option, for [Ruby](/ruby/configuration/options.html#option-enable_host_metrics) and [Elixir](/elixir/configuration/options.html#option-enable_host_metrics).

## Heroku support

To use host metrics on Heroku, head to the [Heroku host metrics][heroku support] page.

##=container-support Docker/container support

To use host metrics on (Docker) containers, head to the [container host metrics](/metrics/host-metrics/containers.html) page.

## Dokku support

[Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku) is very much like Heroku's setup. This is why the AppSignal agent thinks it's running on Heroku. The AppSignal integration turns off host metrics for [Heroku][heroku support] automatically, as Heroku doesn't expose runtime metrics for LXC containers. Instead, we recommend using our [Logplex drain][heroku support].

Since Dokku emulates Heroku's environment by setting the `DYNO` environment variable, host metrics are disabled by default on Dokku as well. To turn them on anyway, you can unset the `DYNO` environment variable for your app. This will make AppSignal not recognize the system as Heroku.

Please note that unsetting the `DYNO` environment variable can have other effects on your Dokku system. Please check with Dokku if this is possible with your setup.
