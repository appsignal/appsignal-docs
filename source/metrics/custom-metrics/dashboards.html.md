!> Outdated page!

Dashboards used to be configured through a YAML file and this page explained how the YAML worked.

These days we have a nice [graphical editor](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=dashboard&overlay=dashboardForm) that is less error prone and easier to use.

We also switched from YAML to JSON for exporting and importing graphs between apps. This feature can be found in the dashboard options menu and when creating a new dashboard.
