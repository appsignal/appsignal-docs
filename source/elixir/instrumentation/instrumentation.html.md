title: "Custom instrumentation for Elixir"
---

In order to find out what specific pieces of code are causing performance
problems it's useful to add custom instrumentation to your application. This
allows us to create better breakdowns of which code runs slowest and what type
of action the most amount of time was spent on.

Custom instrumentation is possible in two ways: using function decorators and
instrumentation helper functions. The function decorators are easiest to use,
but are less flexible than the instrumentation helper functions.

This short guide will help you set up custom instrumentation. More details on
the usage of certain helpers can be found in the Hex docs for the [AppSignal
package](https://hexdocs.pm/appsignal/).

## Function decorators

Using the `Appsignal.Instrumentation.Decorators` decorator module, it's
possible quickly add custom instrumentation to your Elixir applications without
a lot of code.

###^decorator Transaction events

In the following example we have a Phoenix controller with an `index/2`
function which calls a slow function. The `slow` function is instrumented using
the AppSignal `transaction_event` decorator which tracks it a separate event in
this Phoenix request. It will show up on AppSignal.com in the event timeline of
this transaction sample to provide more insight in where the most time was
spent during the request.

```elixir
# Phoenix controller example
defmodule PhoenixExample.PageController do
  use PhoenixExample.Web, :controller
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Decorators

  def index(conn, _params) do
    slow()
    render conn, "index.html"
  end

  # Decorate this function to add custom instrumentation
  @decorate transaction_event
  defp slow do
    :timer.sleep(1000)
  end
end
```

###^decorator Transactions

In the Phoenix example an AppSignal transaction has already been started,
thanks to the first-party support for Phoenix in the AppSignal package. Not all
frameworks and packages are currently supported directly and automatically
start transactions. The same is true for your own pure Elixir applications.

In order to track `transaction_event` decorators we will need to start an
AppSignal transaction beforehand. We can start a transaction with the
`transaction` function decorator.

```elixir
# Pure Elixir example
defmodule FunctionDecoratorsExample do
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Decorators

  # No transaction is started beforehand like in Phoenix, so we need to start
  # it ourselves.
  @decorate transaction
  def call do
    slow()
    # ...
  end

  # Decorate this function to add custom instrumentation
  @decorate transaction_event
  defp slow do
    :timer.sleep(1000)
  end
end
```

###^decorator Namespaces

In order to differentiate between HTTP requests and background jobs we can pass
a namespace to the transaction once we start it.

The following two namespaces are official namespaces supported by AppSignal.

- `http_request` - the default - is called the "web" namespace
- `background_job` - creates the "background" namespace

```elixir
defmodule FunctionDecoratorsExample do
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Decorators

  # No namespace argument defaults to `:http_request`
  @decorate transaction
  def web_function do
    # do stuff
  end

  # The "background" namespace
  @decorate transaction(:background_job)
  def background_function do
    # do stuff
  end
end
```

###^decorator Custom namespaces

You can also create your own namespaces to track transactions in a separate
part of your application such as an administration panel. This will group all
the transactions with this namespace in a separate section on AppSignal.com so
that slow admin controllers don't interfere with the averages of your
application's speed.

```elixir
@decorate transaction(:admin)
def some_function do
  # do stuff
end
```

###^decorator Phoenix channels

There is a custom function decorator for Phoenix channels. This decorator is
meant to be put before the `handle_in/3` function of a `Phoenix.Channel`
module.

```elixir
defmodule FunctionDecoratorsExample.MyChannel do
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Decorators

  # Add this channel function decorator
  @decorate channel_action
  def handle_in("ping", _payload, socket) do
    # your code here..
  end
end
```

Channel events will be displayed under the "background" namespace, showing the
channel module and the action argument that it's used on.

## Instrumentation helper functions

Using the instrumentation helpers it's possible to add custom instrumentation
while retaining a lot of control over what is instrumented.

See also the [appsignal package on hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/appsignal) for
code documentation.

###^helper Instrument helper

In the following example we have a Phoenix controller with an `index/2`
function which performs a couple of complex operations. We will add an
instrumentation function to instrument this complex code. The data collected
during the execution of this code will show up on AppSignal.com in the event
timeline of this transaction sample. It will help provide more insight in where
the most time was spent during the request.

```elixir
# Phoenix controller example
defmodule PhoenixExample.PostController do
  use PhoenixExample.Web, :controller
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Helpers

  def index(conn, _params) do
    # Get the current transaction
    transaction = Appsignal.TransactionRegistery.lookup(self())

    # Instrument a block of code
    instrument(transaction, "query.posts", "Fetching all posts", fn() ->
      # Database queries

      # Instrument a nested block of code
      data = instrument(transaction, "request.s3", "Fetching related post data", fn() ->
        # Third-party API request
      end)

      instrument(transaction, "linking.posts", "Linking post data together", fn() ->
        # Linking database data and S3 data
        # Enum.each(data, fn(x) -> "link post to third-party data" end)
      end)

      # etc
    end)

    render conn, "index.html"
  end
end
```

For more information on what event names to use in the `instrument/4` function,
please read our [event naming guidelines](/api/event-names.html).

###^helper Transactions

In the Phoenix example an AppSignal transaction has already been started,
thanks to the first-party support for Phoenix in the AppSignal package. Not all
frameworks and packages are currently supported directly and automatically
start transactions. The same is true for your own pure Elixir applications.

In order to track the instrumentation functions we will need to start an
AppSignal transaction beforehand. We can start a transaction with
`Appsignal.Transaction.start/2`. Once a transaction is started we can add
transaction events that are recorded by
`Appsignal.Instrumentation.Helpers.instrument/4`.

```elixir
# Pure Elixir example
defmodule InstrumentationHelpersExample do
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Helpers

  def call do
    # Start an AppSignal transaction
    transaction = Appsignal.Transaction.start(
      Appsignal.Transaction.generate_id,
      :http_request
    )

    instrument(transaction, "query.posts", "Fetching all posts", fn() ->
      # Database queries
    end)

    # Finish and close the transaction
    Appsignal.Transaction.finish(transaction)
    :ok = Appsignal.Transaction.complete(transaction)
  end
end
```

###^helper Transaction metadata

Now we have recorded a simple transaction, but the transaction sample itself
might not provide enough context to where the issue occurred or in what
scenario. To provide more context to the sample we can add more metadata to a
transaction.

```elixir
transaction = Appsignal.Transaction.start(
  Appsignal.Transaction.generate_id,
  :http_request
)
# Set the action name of the module/controller and function which is instrumented
|> Appsignal.Transaction.set_action("InstrumentationExample#instrumented_function")
# Add extra data to the transaction. See also our Tagging guide.
|> Appsignal.Transaction.set_sample_data(
  "environment", %{request_path: "/hello", method: "GET"}
)
```

There are also helpers available for when the transaction is not available.
When these are used AppSignal will add the metadata to the currently active
transaction if any.

```elixir
Appsignal.Transaction.set_action("InstrumentationExample#instrumented_function")

# And
Appsignal.Transaction.set_sample_data(
  "environment", %{request_path: "/hello", method: "GET"}
)
```

###^helper Namespaces

In order to differentiate between HTTP requests and background jobs we can pass
a namespace to the transaction once we start it.

The following two namespaces are official namespaces supported by AppSignal.

- `http_request` - the default - is called the "web" namespace
- `background_job` - creates the "background" namespace

```elixir
Appsignal.Transaction.start(
  Appsignal.Transaction.generate_id,
  :background_job
)
```

###^helper Custom namespaces

You can also create your own namespaces to track transactions in a separate
part of your application such as an administration panel. This will group all
the transactions with this namespace in a separate section on AppSignal.com so
that slow admin controllers don't interfere with the averages of your
application's speed.

```elixir
Appsignal.Transaction.start(
  Appsignal.Transaction.generate_id,
  :admin
)
```

###^helper Exception handling

To report errors using custom instrumentation please read more in our
[exception handling guide](/elixir/instrumentation/exception-handling.html).

###^helper Example

This example is set up as procedural as possible so any setup doesn't distract
from the order in which to execute things. You may want to wrap certain parts
in separate functions to make it more reusable.

```elixir
defmodule InstrumentationExample do
  # Include this
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Helpers

  def instrumented_function do
    # Start an AppSignal transaction
    transaction = Appsignal.Transaction.start(
      Appsignal.Transaction.generate_id,
      :http_request
    )
    # Set the action name of the module/controller and function which is instrumented
    |> Appsignal.Transaction.set_action("InstrumentationExample#instrumented_function")
    # Add extra data to the transaction. See also our Tagging guide.
    |> Appsignal.Transaction.set_sample_data(
      "environment", %{request_path: "/hello", method: "GET"}
    )

    try do
      # Instrument specific blocks of code
      instrument(transaction, "complex.function", "Rendering something slow", fn() ->
        :timer.sleep(100)

        # Nest instrumentation
        instrument(transaction, "request.third_party_api", "Slow API call", fn() ->
          :timer.sleep(300)
        end)

        instrument(transaction, "query.custom_database", "Slow query", fn() ->
          :timer.sleep(5000)
        end)

        # Raise an error, not required of course.
        raise("Exception!")
      end)
    rescue
      e ->
        # Report an error in this transaction.
        # It will then be reported as an error instead of a performance issue.
        Appsignal.Transaction.set_error(
          transaction,
          "SomeError",
          "So what went wrong was that I raised an exception earlier..",
          System.stacktrace
        )
    end

    # Finish and close the transaction
    Appsignal.Transaction.finish(transaction)
    :ok = Appsignal.Transaction.complete(transaction)
  end
end
```
