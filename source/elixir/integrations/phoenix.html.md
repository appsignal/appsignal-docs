title: "Integrating AppSignal into Phoenix"
---

The AppSignal for Elixir package integrates with Phoenix. To set up the
integration, please follow our [installation guide](/elixir/installation.html).

This page will describe further ways of configuring AppSignal for the [Phoenix
framework][phoenix]. To add more custom instrumentation to your Phoenix
application, read the [Elixir
instrumentation](/elixir/instrumentation/index.html) documentation.

More information can be found in the [AppSignal Hex package
documentation][hex-appsignal].

## Incoming HTTP requests

To start logging HTTP requests in your Phoenix app, make sure you use the
`Appsignal.Phoenix` module in your `endpoint.ex` file.

```elixir
defmodule AppsignalPhoenixExampleWeb.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :appsignal_phoenix_example
  use Appsignal.Phoenix

  # ...
end
```

This will create a transaction for every HTTP request which is performed on the
endpoint.

## Phoenix instrumentation hooks

Phoenix comes with instrumentation hooks built-in. To send Phoenix'
default instrumentation events to AppSignal, add the following to your
`config.exs` (adjusting for your app's name!).

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :my_app, MyApp.Endpoint,
  instrumenters: [Appsignal.Phoenix.Instrumenter]
```

Using the `Appsignal.Phoenix.Instrumenter` it's possible to add custom
instrumentation to your Phoenix applications.

This module can be used as a Phoenix instrumentation module. Adding this module
to the list of Phoenix instrumenters will result in the
`phoenix_controller_call` and `phoenix_controller_render` events to become part
of your request timeline.

For more information on instrumentation please visit the [AppSignal Hex package
documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/appsignal/).

## Template rendering

It's possible to instrument how much time it takes each template render,
including subtemplates (partials), in your Phoenix application.

To enable this for AppSignal you need to register the AppSignal template
renderer, which augment the compiled templates with instrumentation hooks.

Put the following in your `config.exs`.

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :phoenix, :template_engines,
  eex: Appsignal.Phoenix.Template.EExEngine,
  exs: Appsignal.Phoenix.Template.ExsEngine
```

## Queries

If you're using Ecto 3, attach `Appsignal.Ecto` to Telemetry query events in your application's `start/2` function:

```elixir
:telemetry.attach(
  "appsignal-ecto",
  [:my_app, :repo, :query],
  &Appsignal.Ecto.handle_event/4,
  nil
)
```

For versions of Telemetry &lt; 0.3.0, you'll need to call it slightly differently:

```elixir
Telemetry.attach(
  "appsignal-ecto",
  [:my_app, :repo, :query],
  Appsignal.Ecto,
  :handle_event,
  nil
)
```

On Ecto 2, add the `Appsignal.Ecto` module to your Repo's logger configuration instead. The `Ecto.LogEntry` logger is the default logger for Ecto and needs to be set as well to keep the original Ecto logger behavior intact.

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.Repo,
  loggers: [Appsignal.Ecto, Ecto.LogEntry]
```

-> **Note**: Telemetry support was added in version 1.8.2 of the AppSignal for
Elixir integration.

Note that this is not Phoenix-specific but works for all Ecto queries. The
process that performs the query however, must be associated with an
`Appsignal.Transaction`, otherwise no event will be logged.

## Channels

### Channel instrumentation with a channel's handle

Incoming channel requests can be instrumented by adding code to the
`handle_in/3` function of your application. Function decorators are used to
minimize the amount of code you have to add to your application's channels.

```elixir
defmodule SomeApp.MyChannel do
  use Appsignal.Instrumentation.Decorators

  @decorate channel_action()
  def handle_in("ping", _payload, socket) do
    # your code here..
  end
end
```

Channel events will be displayed under the "Background jobs" tab, showing the
channel module and the action argument that you entered.

### Channel instrumentation without decorators

You can also decide not to use function decorators. In that case, use the
`channel_action/3` function directly, passing in a name for the channel action,
the socket, and the actual code that you are executing in the channel handler.

```elixir
defmodule SomeApp.MyChannel do
  import Appsignal.Phoenix.Channel, only: [channel_action: 4]

  def handle_in("ping" = action, _payload, socket) do
    channel_action(__MODULE__, action, socket, fn ->
      # do some heave processing here...
      reply = perform_work()
      {:reply, {:ok, reply}, socket}
    end)
  end
end
```

## Instrumentation for included Plugs

Exceptions in included Plugs are automatically caught by AppSignal, but
performance samples need to be set up manually using the custom instrumentation
helpers or decorators. See the
[Plug](/elixir/integrations/plug.html#instrumentation-for-included-plugs)
documentation for more information.

## Custom instrumentation

[Add custom instrumentation](/elixir/instrumentation/instrumentation.html) to
keep track of more complex code and get more complete breakdowns of slow
requests.
