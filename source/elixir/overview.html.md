title: "AppSignal for Elixir"
---

AppSignal supports the [Elixir language][elixir-lang] with an [Elixir
package][appsignal-package]. The package supports pure Elixir applications and
the Phoenix framework out-of-the-box. Other frameworks and packages might
require some [custom instrumentation](/elixir/instrumentation/index.html).
