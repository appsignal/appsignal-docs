The first step is to add the AppSignal gem to your bundle. You then
run a generator that will create a config file with the correct API key.
There are various ways to inform AppSignal about deploys of your app
with Capistrano and Heroku amongst others.

The installation instructions contain all the information needed to set
up including easily copy-pastable commands that contain the correct
information for your specific app.

Once you deploy AppSignal will start receiving data and you're good to
go!
