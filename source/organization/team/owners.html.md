title: "Organization owners"
---

There are two ways to manage permissions in AppSignal. A user can be
an owner or a member of [one or more teams](/organization/team/org_teams.html).

An owner has access to everything in your organization. Owners can
invite other users and can determine which other users get to be owner.

You can see the owners in the members screen. You can add change the role of users to member, owner or remove the user.
