title: "Organization members"
---

If you're the owner of an account you can invite other people to become
members of your organization so they can access apps in your organization
on AppSignal.

You can invite a new member in the invitations screen in your
organization's settings. You can find your organization settings
by clicking the settings link at the top right of the screen.

You can make the invitee an account owner by the checking the owner box.
If you check one of the teams the invitee will become a member of those
teams. See [Manage owners & teams](/getting-started/manage-owners-teams.html)
for more information about owners and teams.

outstanding invitations table.

If the invitee has not received an invitation email you can resend the
email. Please contact us at
[support@appsignal.com](mailto:support@appsignal.com) if invitation
emails aren't making it to an inbox. You can delete the invitation if
you have second thoughts about inviting a person.

Once the invitation has been accepted the invitation will not be shown in
the outstanding invitations table anymore. The person will now be
present in the members screen, you can remove the member here if needed.
