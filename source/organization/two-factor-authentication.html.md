AppSignal provides *two-factor authentication* (2FA) to add an extra level of security to your account. Besides using your e-mail address and password, enabling 2FA requires you to enter a one-time password code whenever you sign in. The code is automatically generated by an application on your phone.

## Enabling two-factor authentication

1. Download an authenticator application on your phone. We recommend [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) for Android and iOS users.
2. Visit the [security page](https://appsignal.com/users/security) and click the "Enable two-factor authentication"-button. 
3. Scan the QR code shown on the next page with your authenticator application on your phone.
4. Enter the six-digit code from the application and press "Enable two-factor authentication".
5. 2FA is now enabled. Don't forget to save the backup codes in a safe location. You can use them to sign into AppSignal if you ever lose your phone.
