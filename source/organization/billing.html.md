## Why was one of my charges declined?

There are a number of reasons for a declined charge. All banks have automated systems that decline or accept a charge. We've found that the most common reasons are:

* The card has expired: check the expiration date of the card to make sure it's still valid.
* The billing address does not match the address on the card: check if the billing address in AppSignal matches that on the card.
* The card has insufficient funds: if you use a pre-paid card, check if the card has sufficient funds to accept the charge.
* The card has a monthly spending limit which has been reached: let us know and we can charge you at the beginning of next month and return to the normal billing cycle afterwards.
* A fluke in the matrix, sometimes the card gets declined at random with no specific reason: contact us at <a href="mailto:support@appsignal.com">support@appsignal.com</a> and we'll figure this out together.
