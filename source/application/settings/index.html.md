All settings for an application can be found by clicking the "App Settings" link
in the main menu after you've navigated to an application.

## General

If your app is not connected to a repository on GitHub you can connect it. If
it is connected you can change the linked repository. You need to authenticate
with GitHub to use this feature. You can either do this by signing in via
GitHub, or by linking your GitHub account in your [user
settings](/user-account/index.html). An application linked to
GitHub gives you additional features like direct links to commits.

## Notifications

AppSignal can send alert for a number of events. Configure when a notification
is sent on this page.

See the [application integrations page](/application/integrations/index.html)
to configure where the notification is sent to.

application. You can change the owners and permissions by editing clicking on
the "Manage owners|this team" link.
