### Troubleshooting

If you already linked your organization at GitHub with AppSignal and you are not seeing the repository when you visit the [organization integrations page](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/organization?to=admin/integrations/github). Then click on the "Configure this integration on GitHub" button.

You will be redirected to GitHub, make sure you have selected the repository which is missing in AppSignal, or select "All repositories" and click on "Save" button.

You will be redirected back to AppSignal and you should now be able to see the name of your repository in the "linked repository" drop down.
