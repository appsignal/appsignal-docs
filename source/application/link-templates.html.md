title: "Link templates"

AppSignal supports tagging of requests, as described in our [tagging guide][tagging-guide]. These tags make it possible
to generate URLs to your own application to deep link to pages in your own
system, such as related user profiles or blog posts.

## Tagging requests

For link templates to work AppSignal needs to have the data necessary to create
the links. Start by adding tags to request in your application.

Add the following code in a location where it's executed for the related
request, such as a `before_action` block in a Ruby on Rails application or
using Plug in the Elixir Phoenix framework.

```ruby
# Ruby example
Appsignal.tag_request(
  :user_id    => current_user.id
  :account_id => current_account.id
)
```

```elixir
# Elixir example
Appsignal.Span.set_sample_data(
  Appsignal.Tracer.root_span,
  "tags",
  %{
    locale: "en",
    user_id: user_id,
    stripe_customer_id: stripe_customer_id,
    locale: locale,
    default_locale: default_locale
  }
)
```

-> ðŸ“– For more information about tagging requests, please read the [tagging guide][tagging-guide].

## Creating a link template

Link templates can be defined on AppSignal.com per application.

The "Link templates" configuration can be found in the ["App settings" section](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=edit) in the left-hand side navigation.

Link templates can contain variables, defined by wrapping them in percentage signs
`%%`. For example, the `user_id` tag can be used in a link like so:

```
https://yourapp.com/backend/users/%user_id%
```

A link can contain as many variables as you like, but in order for a link to be
generated, all variables need to be present in the tags of a request.

After adding tags in your app and defining link templates, links will be
generated for each request in the "Overview" section.

### Customizing link names

By default the tags and links table will increment links, e.g. "Link 1", "Link 2", "Link 3". If you want to use more descriptive link names you can do so with this format:

```
[Backend]https://yourapp.com/backend/users/%user_id%
```
