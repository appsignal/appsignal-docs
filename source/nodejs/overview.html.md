title: "AppSignal for Node.js"
---

AppSignal now supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)! 

We're proud to bring the same great performance monitoring and error tracking that we offer Ruby and Elixir customers to the Node.js ecosystem. The package supports pure JavaScript applications and TypeScript applications, and can auto-instrument various frameworks and packages with optional plugins. Other frameworks and packages might require some custom instrumentation.

The new Node.js implementation contains some concepts that vary from the Ruby and Elixir implementations. Be sure to check out the [Tracing section][tracing] to familiarize yourself with any differences.

-> **Note**: AppSignal for Node.js is currently under active development.
