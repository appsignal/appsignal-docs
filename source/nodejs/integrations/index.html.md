AppSignal works with most popular Node.js frameworks and packages out-of-the-box such as:

- [Apollo Server](apollo.html)
- [Express](express.html)
- [Koa.js](koajs.html)
- [Next.js](nextjs.html)
- [Node.js Core](core.html)
- [node-postgres](pg.html)
- [node-redis](redis.html)

More integrations and plugins are being added all the time! Check our [issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/issues) to see if we're working on something for your chosen framework or library.
