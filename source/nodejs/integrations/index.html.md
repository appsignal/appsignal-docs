title: "Node.js integrations"
---

AppSignal works with most popular Node.js frameworks and packages out-of-the-box such as:

* [Node.js Core](core.html)
* [Express](express.html)
* [Next.js](nextjs.html)
* [node-postgres](pg.html)

More integrations and plugins are being added all the time! Check our [issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/issues) to see if we're working on something for your chosen framework or library.
