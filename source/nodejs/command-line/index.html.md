The optional [`@appsignal/cli` package][package] includes several command-line tools. These tools make it easier to install AppSignal in an application, send deploy notifications and diagnose any problems with the installation.

## Install

A command-line tool to install AppSignal in an application.

Read more about the [`npx @appsignal/cli install`][cli-install] command line tool.

## Diagnose
