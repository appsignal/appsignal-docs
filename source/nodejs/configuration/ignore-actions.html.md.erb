## Ignore by span name

The name of a `Span` maps to an "action name" on AppSignal.com. An action name is used to identify the location of a certain sample error and performance issues. You can see a list of these in the "Action name" column of the _Issue list_ under [Performance](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=performance) in the sidebar.

To ignore a span by name, add that name to the `ignoreActions` array:

```js
const appsignal = new Appsignal({
  active: true,
  name: "<YOUR APPLICATION NAME>",
  ignoreActions: ["GET /ignore-me", "GET /ignore-me-too"]
})
```
