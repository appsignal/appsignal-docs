AppSignal works with most popular Ruby frameworks and gems out-of-the-box such
as:

* [Active Job](active-job.html)
* [Capistrano](capistrano.html)
* [DataMapper](datamapper.html)
* [Delayed::Job](delayed-job.html)
* [Grape](grape.html)
* [MongoDB](mongodb.html)
* [Padrino](padrino.html)
* [Rack](rack.html)
* [Rake](rake.html)
* [Resque](resque.html)
* [Ruby on Rails](rails.html)
* [Sequel](sequel.html)
* [Shoryuken](shoryuken.html)
* [Sidekiq](sidekiq.html)
* [Sinatra](sinatra.html)
* [Webmachine](webmachine.html)

We try to make most integrations work automatically, but some might require
some manual configuration steps.

If a certain library isn't automatically supported it's possible to [integrate
AppSignal manually][integrating].

repository][examples-repo].
